## **Task

## Solution

**Step 1:** Open the lab link to access the Windows GUI instance

This lab environment will provide you with access to a pre-configured Windows system that has all the required tools installed.

**Step 2:** Starting the Gophish server

To begin with, you will need to startup the Gophish server, this can be done by double clicking on the **gophish.exe** shortcut on the desktop of the Windows system you have been provided access to as shown in the following screenshot.

As shown in the following screenshot, once the Gophish server is started up you will be provided with a command prompt session that will display the current working state of the Gophish server in addition to the local port it is listening on.

In this case, the Gophish server is listening on port **https://127.0.0.1:3333**.

You can access the Gophish admin panel by navigating to the aforementioned address in a web browser like Firefox.

**Step 3:** Setting up a Gophish sending profile

Now that we have started the Gophish server and logged in to the admin panel, we can begin the process of setting up a phishing email.

To begin with, we will need to setup a sending profile, this can be done by clicking on the **Sending Profiles** menu item on the sidebar of the dashboard as shown in the following screenshot.

This will bring up the sending profile customization prompt where you can specify different criteria based on your requirements, in this case, we will use the following configuration for the sending profile:

1. Name: red
2. From: info **[support@demo.ine.local](mailto:support@demo.ine.local)**
3. Host: localhost:25
4. Username: red@demo.ine.local
5. Password: penetrationtesting

After configuring the sending profile accordingly, we can test the configuration by clicking on the **Send Test Email** button as shown in the following screenshot.

This will prompt you to specify the details of the recipient, in this case we will be sending the test email to **victim@demo.ine.local** whose mailbox has already been configured in Thunderbird.

![Content Image](https://assets.ine.com/content/ptp/AlexisAhmed/VOD-4379/LAB-3874/11.png)

To verify that the test email was sent successfully, we can open up the Thunderbird email client installed and configured on the Windows system. As shown in the following screenshot, the test email was sent and received successfully thus confirming that the sending profile is functional.

**Step 4:** Setting up a Gophish landing page

In order for us to setup a successful phishing campaign, we will need to setup a landing page where target users will be directed to for credential harvesting.

To begin with, we can click on the **Landing Pages** menu item on the side menu of the dashboard as shown in the following screenshot.

We can then create a new landing page by clicking on the **New Page** button as highlighted in the preceding screenshot.

This will bring up the landing page customization prompt, where we can specify the site we would like to emulate or clone for the purpose of the phishing campaign.

In this case, we will be using a custom landing page being hosted on the **localhost:8080**.

As shown in the following screenshot, we can specify the landing page name and click on the **Import Site** button to import the pre-existing landing page.
